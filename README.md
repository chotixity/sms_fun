This is a fun project that is meant to help me manage my expenditure on mpesa. it records messages as they come in. Filters for the one from Mpesa and Updates the UI.

The Idea is to categorize them based on outoings and incomings, give me the ability to add a description to a transcation, Ability to search for for transactions based on the receiver of the money.

It is currently supporting android only
